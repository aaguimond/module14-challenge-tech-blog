## Purpose

To demonstrate my knowledge of the MVC framework and create a tech blog from scratch. It's a culmination of all of the web development skills I've learned up until this point, with HTML, CSS, Javascript, database management, API routes, and lots of problem solving.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, all of the dependencies can be installed by running "npm install" within a terminal. Please make sure to add any environmental variables within your own .env file. There is an included .env.EXAMPLE file in the repository that contains each required environmental variable. If running locally, make sure that your server hosting program is started. I used PostgreSQL to test the application's functionality, so I opened pgAdmin and then ran "psql -U postgres -f db/schema.sql" to initialize the database. If seeding the database, please run "npm seed" in the terminal. Initialize the server by typing "npm start". The application will now function locally.

## Usage

This application is also being hosted on Render. Please visit the site at the link [here](#project-status) to use the application.
